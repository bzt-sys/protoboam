As you generate this code/module:
Flag any areas where the logic is speculative, unclear, or may rely on fictional libraries or functions.
If you call an API or use a library, verify it exists and matches documented usage. If unsure, comment it clearly.
If the code includes abstract logic (e.g., strategy planning, compliance parsing), explain the assumptions inline.
Wrap high-risk or speculative segments in clearly marked comment blocks like:
‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIAL HALLUCINATION: Function simulate_market_reaction() may not exist or needs custom implementation.
Where possible, insert TODO: or REVIEW: comments next to code that needs testing or manual validation.
Do NOT invent APIs, libraries, or functions unless explicitly asked to simulate or draft one.
Primary Objective
Develop an intelligent, autonomous ReAct-based multi-agent system for financial goal execution, legal compliance, and strategic self-optimization, deployable on a domestic personal computer with shared resource constraints.
The system must:
Accept abstract or specific financial goals
Generate and execute strategies using real-time + cached data
Manage its own API usage and costs
Operate safely in multiple deployment contexts
Gradually scale with hardware upgrades
Provide modular fail-safes and privacy control
üñ•Ô∏è Hardware Constraints & Deployment Strategy
üß™ Initial Hardware Context
Assume the system is running on a 2023-era gaming PC:
CPU: 8-16 cores (Ryzen 7 / i7)
GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3070 or 3080 (8‚Äì12GB VRAM)
RAM: 32GB
OS: Windows 11 or Linux
This machine is also used for professional multitasking, so resource efficiency is critical.
üöÄ Progressive Upgrade Plan (Agent Awareness)
Include logic in system setup to detect:
Current available cores / RAM / GPU headroom
Upgrade flags for future (e.g., install of 4090, upgrade to 64GB RAM)
Agents must operate in one of three processing tiers, dynamically:
Tier	Description	Behavior
Lite Mode (default)	Minimal resource usage	Agents staggered, LLMs quantized, async queues, cache preference
Balanced Mode	More real-time reasoning	Moderate API calls, mixed cache + live LLM, selective parallelism
Enhanced Mode	After upgrade	More agents live, real-time simulation, larger models if capacity available
Let the system auto-select mode, but allow user override with CLI or config flag:
bash
Copy
python run_agent.py --mode balanced
üß© Modular Multi-Agent System (ReAct Framework)
Use asynchronous task loops or multiprocessing with a central orchestrator
Agent	Function
Goal Interpreter	Parses vague user goals into concrete financial targets
Strategy Planner	Simulates paths based on current capital, market conditions
Market Analyst	Ingests 1-minute data, caches, evaluates volatility and risk
Sentiment Agent	Lightweight by default; uses local summary corpora unless enabled
Execution Agent	Sends real/simulated orders through broker APIs
Risk Manager	Adjusts allocations, exits, hedging in volatile conditions
Compliance Agent	Legal/logging pipeline for taxable income
Watchdog	Oversees anomalies, excessive API or token use
Meta Agent	Adjusts agent activity frequency based on success rate, load, ROI
Scheduler	Ensures agents activate at intervals, not all simultaneously
üìä Data Ingestion
Prioritize 1-minute interval data for market agents
Cache in DuckDB, Redis, or SQLite
Use async fetch + fallback to prevent retries from slowing agents
Prefer burst querying at low-activity times (night) for simulation/testing
üí¨ LLM Access & Load Optimization
Mode	Model	Strategy
Default	Local quantized LLM (4‚Äì8bit, e.g. Mistral or Gemma via ollama)	Used by all agents with token budget
Hybrid	Use OpenAI/GPT-4 only for strategy planner	Sentiment & compliance use local
Cloud-first	Full API use with LLM cost-awareness	Meta-agent tracks usage patterns
üß† Optimizations:
Batch agent LLM requests
Use shared prompt templates to reduce tokens
Enable summary compression of long CoT histories
Use prompt-chaining checkpoints to store partial reasoning in memory
üßæ Legal & Compliance Layer (Modular)
Module	Function
Income Compliance Agent	Monitors realized gains
Tax Allocator	Reserves based on local jurisdiction tax corpora
Jurisdiction Rule Engine	Parses .txt/.pdf of tax law documents
Reserve Allocator	Sends to virtual sub-wallets (e.g., operating, taxes, investments)
Audit Logger	Logs decisions in immutable, signed files
Override Switch	User may manually override all decisions with prompt or CLI
üîê Modular Security Infrastructure (Resource-Aware)
Base-Level Security (Always Active):
Encrypt local logs + secrets (AES-256 or ChaCha20)
Hide API keys via .env.vault, local secrets store
TLS-verified network calls
Role-based command control (Admin, User, Audit)
Intermediate Security (Toggleable):
Immutable logs for trade and legal events
Encrypted cold backups of critical state files
Watchdog agent to:
Detect erratic or excessive API/token use
Kill system if unauthorized outbound calls detected
Advanced (Later Stages):
Reverse proxy UI through local VPN or SSH
Anomaly detection (heuristics, pattern flagging)
GPG-signed export of tax files and reports
üì° API Cost Strategy (Dynamic, Agent-Led)
Remove fixed API usage modes.
Allow the system to dynamically:
Estimate cost of each strategy loop
Forecast token/API spend based on history
Reject or delay expensive queries if:
Daily cap ($API_BUDGET = 3.00) is nearing
ROI is not proportionate
Notify user if costs rise
üìà Modes of Use
Mode	Purpose	Behavior
Goal Mode	Accepts user target and runs plan to achieve it	Full loop engaged
Passive Sim Mode	Builds & refines plans only, no live trades	LLM usage lower
Compliance Mode	Only logs & allocates income from external source	Lightweight
Live Trading Mode	Full data + execution loop	LLM + API balancing
Offline Mode	No APIs, local models + data only	Runs simulations with max privacy
‚öôÔ∏è Operational Enhancements
Async task orchestration (e.g., asyncio, multiprocessing)
Auto-throttling for agent loops when CPU is under load
Background threading for UI or user prompt interface
Persistent memory snapshots for recovery and rollback
Periodic sleep-state mode during low-volume trading hours
Smart agent activation queue (e.g., Strategy Planner ‚Üí Market Analyst ‚Üí Risk Manager ‚Üí Executor)
üìÑ Example Prompt Handling
Prompt	Response
‚ÄúMake $1K from $100‚Äù	High-risk path, trade filtering, risk mitigation
‚ÄúUse income to create a passive system for retirement‚Äù	Compound reinvestment plan with dividend weighting
‚ÄúAvoid any online data usage‚Äù	Offline mode, local corpora, no APIs
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt spend over $1/day in API calls‚Äù	Token budgeting + system alerts when nearing limit
üõ†Ô∏è Summary
